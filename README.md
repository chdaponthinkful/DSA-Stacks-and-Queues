# 1.3.8 DSA-Stacks-and-Queues

Tasks
Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment. Just like in the lesson, you will use a linked list in your implementation.

In the src/Stack.js file:

Complete the push() method to insert a node into the stack. The method should accept an argument data that represents the data to be stored in the node. Use the provided _Node class to create new node instances.

Complete the pop() method to remove a node from a stack. The method should return the data stored in the deleted node.

In the src/Queue.js file:

Complete the enqueue() method to insert a node into a queue. The method should accept an argument data that represents the data to be stored in the node. Use the provided _Node class to create new node instances.

Complete the dequeue() method to remove a node from a queue. The method should return the data stored in the deleted node. If the queue is already empty, then the method should return undefined.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
